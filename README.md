## üîß Recent Improvements (August¬†2025)

This version of the site includes a handful of refinements based on user feedback and testing:

- **Trust badges updated** ‚Äì The generic ‚ÄúPlaceholder‚Äù labels in the hero section have been replaced with clear value propositions: free shipping on all orders, a 100¬†% satisfaction guarantee, and the use of kid‚Äësafe materials.
- **Responsive hero imagery** ‚Äì The hero illustration now scales fluidly without hard‚Äëcoded dimensions, preventing awkward cropping on smaller screens and ensuring the artwork preview remains fully visible.
- **Centered navigation** ‚Äì On larger screens the navigation links are centered between the logo and the hamburger menu. The menu still collapses into a slide‚Äëout panel on mobile devices, but remains balanced and easy to tap.
- **Gallery revamp** ‚Äì The before/after gallery now uses an interactive component that allows visitors to toggle between the original artwork and the outlined coloring page. Images can be opened in a built‚Äëin lightbox when clicked, and cards are constrained to their parent grid cell so they don‚Äôt overflow on mobile.
- **Contact form integration** ‚Äì The contact form submits directly to our Formspree endpoint (`https://formspree.io/f/myzdgllv`) and shows a success notification upon completion. All fields are required and error handling has been improved.

These changes are meant to improve usability and polish while keeping the whimsical spirit of the original design.

- **Focus Management**: Proper tab order and focus indicators
